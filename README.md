# Bike_Buyers_Analysis
In this project focused on bike buyers' analysis, I leveraged the capabilities of Microsoft Excel to design and develop a dynamic and comprehensive summary dashboard. The primary goal of the project was to gain deep insights into the characteristics, preferences, and behaviors of bike buyers, enabling better strategic decisions for marketing and sales efforts. 
To achieve this I started by cleaning the data and removing any unnecessary data. Then, I created pivot tables of the specific information needed to design my pivot charts. These pivot charts were put together and used to create the dashboard below.
